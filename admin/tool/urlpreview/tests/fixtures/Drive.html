Standard Range Plus: owner review</a></h3></div><div class="articleCard_drive-article-card__thumbnail__description__SMZd8">As
 a former Telsa owner (2017 Model S75) I had no hesitation ordering a 
Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR +) when they became available in 
Australia.  I have had the car for over a year and have racked up 23000 
km so thought now would be a good time to provide an ownership update.
Why a Model 3 - I always wanted a Model 3 and purchased a Model S to 
tide me over until the Model 3 arrived.  Having experience with the 
range of my Model S (which is the same as the SR+) I decided to order 
the base Model 3 in the free colour which was white.  I did cross shop 
the Model 3 with the BMW 3 series, Audi A4 and Mercedes C Class but each
 of those cars was more expensive (I paid $71 358 OTR in Brisbane - 
December 2019), slower and had higher servicing costs.
Performance and Efficiency - The SR+ is not fast at 5.6 seconds 0-100 
kph but I wouldn't call it slow either.  It has a good spread of power 
and torque.  My lifetime electrical consumption for the car is 136 Wh/km
 or 13.6 kWh/100 km which is very good for a car of its size and 
performance.
Build Quality, Running Costs and Maintenance -  There is a lot of 
commentary about Tesla build quality.  I am sure, like a number of 
brands, that some owners get cars that are below par in this area.  All I
 can say is that my Model 3 is well built, has good quality paint and 
the car has no squeaks or rattles.  In fact the car is better built than
 my 2017 Model S was so on my sample size of two I would assess that 
Tesla is continuing to improve quality as they scale production.
Running costs on the car are dirt cheap.  I pay 20 cents for a kWh of 
electricity so the Model 3 costs me about $2.70 in electricity for every
 100 km driven or $27 for every 1000 km. The cars I cross shopped would 
all cost about $120 to fuel for every 1000 km driven (assuming 
8L/100km).  Over 100 000 km that works out to about $2700 for the Model 3
 versus $12 000 for the equivalent ICE.  I know some might say my 
battery will fail and the car will be worthless but the 8 Year/160 000 
km battery warranty guarantees that the battery will be replaced if the 
battery degrades below 70 percent capacity.  Given the performance of 
Tesla's batteries since 2012 I have no concerns with the battery 
failing.
Maintenance - In over a year of ownership I have had the tyres rotated 
once through Tesla Mobile Service (scheduled through the app) at a cost 
of $50.  At the two year mark I will get the brake fluid checked and the
 wiper blades changed.  Since owning the car I have had no need to 
address any warranty issues. 
Road Trips and Driving - I have travelled pretty extensively in the car 
including return trips from Brisbane to Newcastle and Melbourne.  The 
Supercharger Network makes these trips pretty simple. These trips didn't
 cost me anything as I had two referrals that gave me 3000 km worth of 
free supercharging when I purchased the car. Even in the shortest range 
Model 3 these trips are very doable and on my Melbourne trip I drove 
Brisbane to Goulburn (1100 km) in one day.  The car is easy to drive, 
comfortable to spend a lot of time in and the one pedal driving is 
addictive once you get used to it.
All Electric Garage - Recently I took the leap and changed out my wife's
 car for a Mini Cooper Electric that I purchased as an ex demo at a 
considerable saving off the new price.  Again its purchase price was 
very comparable to its ICE equivalent. It's a great little car that is 
proving very efficient as well (12.5 kWh/100 km). 
I have family members who have V8's (Lexus LC500 and another brother has
 a Mustang Mach 1 on order) so if I need my V8 noise fix I go and visit 
them.  For my families use case, budget and lifestyle EVs are the 
perfect fit.  I look forward to the increasing range of EVs coming to 
Australia and hopefully prices will continue to fall as competition 
increases.

 hate to say it, but I am yet another a convert. I bought a model 3 
cancelled order, so was driving away in a new car only a week after my 
deposit. White with White.
I, at first thought I have made a mistake here. Me and that car felt 
like an arranged marriage. 
I hardly had time to think about pros and cons before I was sitting in 
the thing at my first traffic lights trying to work out the basic 
function of the car. 
It felt bit like like sitting in a vacant apartment. No furniture,  no 
noise and no apparent personality. Everything felt and sounded strange. 
Now two weeks and 1200kms in, I love it.  The exterior build quality is 
terrible, the paint shockingly bad. Fit and finish is like a 1970's 
Cadillac, but I am told thats normal. Inside is quiet, comfy and solid. I
 am happy with the seats, the screen, the stereo and the simple 
dashboard, I tell myself its 'danish design,' and it works. 
The main difference for me however is how much I enjoy driving it. It 
stops and GOES amazingly well, it can handle bumps and bends like a BMW,
 and on the highway it has the best auto pilot I have ever experienced. 
The power is addictive, and actually useful as it is so instant, and the
 thing is quiet. 
Interestingly as a new owner you will need to the aftermarket to make 
the car 'Premium', floor mats, boot liners, A wireless phone charger, 
memory stick for sensory mode, sun roof shade panels for summer, trunk 
struts, puncture repair kit and window tinting just a start.... 
But it is a massive leap forward by Mr Musk. He will over time become 
better at making them, and Europe and Korea will no doubt catch and over
 take him.  They have been making cars for 90yrs after all, but the 
Model 3 is a joy to own and drive, a pleasure to travel in, and always 
gets interest and questions. 
Tesla after sales support has been good.
I give it a 9/10.... so far.

04:04:35","title":"2019 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus: owner review","slug":"2019-tesla-model-3-standard-range-plus-review","excerpt":"As a former Telsa owner (2017 Model S75) I had no hesitation ordering a Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR +) when they became available in Australia.  I have had the car for over a year and have racked up 23000 km so thought now would be a good time to provide an ownership update.\nWhy a Model 3 - I always wanted a Model 3 and purchased a Model S to tide me over until the Model 3 arrived.  Having experience with the range of my Model S (which is the same as the SR+) I decided to order the base Model 3 in the free colour which was white.  I did cross shop the Model 3 with the BMW 3 series, Audi A4 and Mercedes C Class but each of those cars was more expensive (I paid $71 358 OTR in Brisbane - December 2019), slower and had higher servicing costs.\nPerformance and Efficiency - The SR+ is not fast at 5.6 seconds 0-100 kph but I wouldn't call it slow either.  It has a good spread of power and torque.  My lifetime electrical consumption for the car is 136 Wh/km or 13.6 kWh/100 km which is very good for a car of its size and performance.\nBuild Quality, Running Costs and Maintenance -  There is a lot of commentary about Tesla build quality.  I am sure, like a number of brands, that some owners get cars that are below par in this area.  All I can say is that my Model 3 is well built, has good quality paint and the car has no squeaks or rattles.  In fact the car is better built than my 2017 Model S was so on my sample size of two I would assess that Tesla is continuing to improve quality as they scale production.\nRunning costs on the car are dirt cheap.  I pay 20 cents for a kWh of electricity so the Model 3 costs me about $2.70 in electricity for every 100 km driven or $27 for every 1000 km. The cars I cross shopped would all cost about $120 to fuel for every 1000 km driven (assuming 8L/100km).  Over 100 000 km that works out to about $2700 for the Model 3 versus $12 000 for the equivalent ICE.  I know some might say my battery will fail and the car will be worthless but the 8 Year/160 000 km battery warranty guarantees that the battery will be replaced if the battery degrades below 70 percent capacity.  Given the performance of Tesla's batteries since 2012 I have no concerns with the battery failing.\nMaintenance - In over a year of ownership I have had the tyres rotated once through Tesla Mobile Service (scheduled through the app) at a cost of $50.  At the two year mark I will get the brake fluid checked and the wiper blades changed.  Since owning the car I have had no need to address any warranty issues. \nRoad Trips and Driving - I have travelled pretty extensively in the car including return trips from Brisbane to Newcastle and Melbourne.  The Supercharger Network makes these trips pretty simple. These trips didn't cost me anything as I had two referrals that gave me 3000 km worth of free supercharging when I purchased the car. Even in the shortest range Model 3 these trips are very doable and on my Melbourne trip I drove Brisbane to Goulburn (1100 km) in one day.  The car is easy to drive, comfortable to spend a lot of time in and the one pedal driving is addictive once you get used to it.\nAll Electric Garage - Recently I took the leap and changed out my wife's car for a Mini Cooper Electric that I purchased as an ex demo at a considerable saving off the new price.  Again its purchase price was very comparable to its ICE equivalent. It's a great little car that is proving very efficient as well (12.5 kWh/100 km). \nI have family members who have V8's (Lexus LC500 and another brother has a Mustang Mach 1 on order) so if I need my V8 noise fix I go and visit them.  For my families use case, budget and lifestyle EVs are the perfect fit.  I look forward to the increasing range of EVs coming to Australia and hopefully prices will continue to fall as competition increases.\n \n","featuredImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/caradvice/image/private/q_auto/v1617149137/dihwh5tdeo8ckf4jlbwx.jpg","id":"cG9zdDoyODIwODM4","databaseId":2820838,"title":"dihwh5tdeo8ckf4jlbwx","caption":"","cloudinary":{"cloudName":"caradvice","publicId":"dihwh5tdeo8ckf4jlbwx","deliveryType":"private","__typename":"Cloudinary"},"__typename":"CustomMediaItem"},"author":{"name":"Owner Review","nicename":"owner-review","slug":"owner-review","avatar":{"sourceUrl":"https://images.drive.com.au/driveau/image/upload/t_wp-default/v1/cms/uploads/ct2qvvtrrbyvno30ixy8","cloudinary":{"cloudName":"driveau","deliveryType":"","publicId":"cms/uploads/ct2qvvtrrbyvno30ixy8","__typename":"Cloudinary"},"__typename":"CustomMediaItem"},"__typename":"DriveAuthor"},"disqus":{"threadIdentifier":"939269 https://www.caradvice.com.au/?post_type=owner-reviews\u0026#038;p=939269","threadID":null,"__typename":"PostDisqus"},"tags":[{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","__typename":"DriveTags"},{"name":"tesla model 3","slug":"tesla-model-3","__typename":"DriveTags"},{"name":"Model 3","slug":"model-3","__typename":"DriveTags"},{"name":"owner review","slug":"owner-review","__typename":"DriveTags"}],"__typename":"AttachedPost"},{"postSubTypes":["Owner Review"],"postId":"cG9zdDoyODIxMDM0","postDatabaseId":"2821034","postType":"reviews","date":"2020-07-31 13:49:49","title":"2020 Tesla Model 3 Performance: owner review","slug":"2020-tesla-model-3-performance-review","excerpt":"I hate to say it, but I am yet another a convert. I bought a model 3 cancelled order, so was driving away in a new car only a week after my deposit. White with White.\nI, at first thought I have made a mistake here. Me and that car felt like an arranged marriage. \nI hardly had time to think about pros and cons before I was sitting in the thing at my first traffic lights trying to work out the basic function of the car. \nIt felt bit like like sitting in a vacant apartment. No furniture,  no noise and no apparent personality. Everything felt and sounded strange. \nNow two weeks and 1200kms in, I love it.  The exterior build quality is terrible, the paint shockingly bad. Fit and finish is like a 1970's Cadillac, but I am told thats normal. Inside is quiet, comfy and solid. I am happy with the seats, the screen, the stereo and the simple dashboard, I tell myself its 'danish design,' and it works. \nThe main difference for me however is how much I enjoy driving it. It stops and GOES amazingly well, it can handle bumps and bends like a BMW, and on the highway it has the best auto pilot I have ever experienced. The power is addictive, and actually useful as it is so instant, and the thing is quiet. \nInterestingly as a new owner you will need to the aftermarket to make the car 'Premium', floor mats, boot liners, A wireless phone charger, memory stick for sensory mode, sun roof shade panels for summer, trunk struts, puncture repair kit and window tinting just a start.... \nBut it is a massive leap forward by Mr Musk. He will over time become better at making them, and Europe and Korea will no doubt catch and over take him.  They have been making cars for 90yrs after all, but the Model 3 is a joy to own and drive, a pleasure to travel in, and always gets interest and questions. \nTesla after sales support has been good.\nI give it a 9/10.... so far.\n","featuredImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/caradvice/image/private/s--8GvJY0hr--/v1595198704/mnlzz8lejqzoblbauudu.jpg","id":"cG9zdDoyODIxMjc5","databaseId":2821279,"title":"mnlzz8lejqzoblbauudu","caption":"","cloudinary":{"cloudName":"caradvice","publicId":"mnlzz8lejqzoblbauudu","deliveryType":"private","__typename":"Cloudinary"},"__typename":"CustomMediaItem"},"author":{"name":"Owner

review","slug":"2019-tesla-model-3-standard-range-plus-review","excerpt":"As a former Telsa owner (2017 Model S75) I had no hesitation ordering a Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR +) when they became available in Australia.  I have had the car for over a year and have racked up 23000 km so thought now would be a good time to provide an ownership update.\nWhy a Model 3 - I always wanted a Model 3 and purchased a Model S to tide me over until the Model 3 arrived.  Having experience with the range of my Model S (which is the same as the SR+) I decided to order the base Model 3 in the free colour which was white.  I did cross shop the Model 3 with the BMW 3 series, Audi A4 and Mercedes C Class but each of those cars was more expensive (I paid $71 358 OTR in Brisbane - December 2019), slower and had higher servicing costs.\nPerformance and Efficiency - The SR+ is not fast at 5.6 seconds 0-100 kph but I wouldn't call it slow either.  It has a good spread of power and torque.  My lifetime electrical consumption for the car is 136 Wh/km or 13.6 kWh/100 km which is very good for a car of its size and performance.\nBuild Quality, Running Costs and Maintenance -  There is a lot of commentary about Tesla build quality.  I am sure, like a number of brands, that some owners get cars that are below par in this area.  All I can say is that my Model 3 is well built, has good quality paint and the car has no squeaks or rattles.  In fact the car is better built than my 2017 Model S was so on my sample size of two I would assess that Tesla is continuing to improve quality as they scale production.\nRunning costs on the car are dirt cheap.  I pay 20 cents for a kWh of electricity so the Model 3 costs me about $2.70 in electricity for every 100 km driven or $27 for every 1000 km. The cars I cross shopped would all cost about $120 to fuel for every 1000 km driven (assuming 8L/100km).  Over 100 000 km that works out to about $2700 for the Model 3 versus $12 000 for the equivalent ICE.  I know some might say my battery will fail and the car will be worthless but the 8 Year/160 000 km battery warranty guarantees that the battery will be replaced if the battery degrades below 70 percent capacity.  Given the performance of Tesla's batteries since 2012 I have no concerns with the battery failing.\nMaintenance - In over a year of ownership I have had the tyres rotated once through Tesla Mobile Service (scheduled through the app) at a cost of $50.  At the two year mark I will get the brake fluid checked and the wiper blades changed.  Since owning the car I have had no need to address any warranty issues. \nRoad Trips and Driving - I have travelled pretty extensively in the car including return trips from Brisbane to Newcastle and Melbourne.  The Supercharger Network makes these trips pretty simple. These trips didn't cost me anything as I had two referrals that gave me 3000 km worth of free supercharging when I purchased the car. Even in the shortest range Model 3 these trips are very doable and on my Melbourne trip I drove Brisbane to Goulburn (1100 km) in one day.  The car is easy to drive, comfortable to spend a lot of time in and the one pedal driving is addictive once you get used to it.\nAll Electric Garage - Recently I took the leap and changed out my wife's car for a Mini Cooper Electric that I purchased as an ex demo at a considerable saving off the new price.  Again its purchase price was very comparable to its ICE equivalent. It's a great little car that is proving very efficient as well (12.5 kWh/100 km). \nI have family members who have V8's (Lexus LC500 and another brother has a Mustang Mach 1 on order) so if I need my V8 noise fix I go and visit them.  For my families use case, budget and lifestyle EVs are the perfect fit.  I look forward to the increasing range of EVs coming to Australia and hopefully prices will continue to fall as competition increases.\n \n","featuredImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/caradvice/image/private/q_auto/v1617149137/dihwh5tdeo8ckf4jlbwx.jpg","id":"cG9zdDoyODIwODM4","databaseId":2820838,"title":"dihwh5tdeo8ckf4jlbwx","caption":"","cloudinary":{"cloudName":"caradvice","publicId":"dihwh5tdeo8ckf4jlbwx","deliveryType":"private","__typename":"Cloudinary"},"__typename":"CustomMediaItem"},"author":{"name":"Owner Review","nicename":"owner-review","slug":"owner-review","avatar":{"sourceUrl":"https://images.drive.com.au/driveau/image/upload/t_wp-default/v1/cms/uploads/ct2qvvtrrbyvno30ixy8","cloudinary":{"cloudName":"driveau","deliveryType":"","publicId":"cms/uploads/ct2qvvtrrbyvno30ixy8","__typename":"Cloudinary"},"__typename":"CustomMediaItem"},"__typename":"DriveAuthor"},"disqus":{"threadIdentifier":"939269 https://www.caradvice.com.au/?post_type=owner-reviews\u0026#038;p=939269","threadID":null,"__typename":"PostDisqus"},"tags":[{"name":"tesla","slug":"tesla","__typename":"DriveTags"},{"name":"tesla model 3","slug":"tesla-model-3","__typename":"DriveTags"},{"name":"Model 3","slug":"model-3","__typename":"DriveTags"},{"name":"owner review","slug":"owner-review","__typename":"DriveTags"}],"__typename":"AttachedPost"},{"postSubTypes":["Owner Review"],"postId":"cG9zdDoyODIxMDM0","postDatabaseId":"2821034","postType":"reviews","date":"2020-07-31 13:49:49","title":"2020 Tesla Model 3 Performance: owner review","slug":"2020-tesla-model-3-performance-review","excerpt":"I hate to say it, but I am yet another a convert. I bought a model 3 cancelled order, so was driving away in a new car only a week after my deposit. White with White.\nI, at first thought I have made a mistake here. Me and that car felt like an arranged marriage. \nI hardly had time to think about pros and cons before I was sitting in the thing at my first traffic lights trying to work out the basic function of the car. \nIt felt bit like like sitting in a vacant apartment. No furniture,  no noise and no apparent personality. Everything felt and sounded strange. \nNow two weeks and 1200kms in, I love it.  The exterior build quality is terrible, the paint shockingly bad. Fit and finish is like a 1970's Cadillac, but I am told thats normal. Inside is quiet, comfy and solid. I am happy with the seats, the screen, the stereo and the simple dashboard, I tell myself its 'danish design,' and it works. \nThe main difference for me however is how much I enjoy driving it. It stops and GOES amazingly well, it can handle bumps and bends like a BMW, and on the highway it has the best auto pilot I have ever experienced. The power is addictive, and actually useful as it is so instant, and the thing is quiet. \nInterestingly as a new owner you will need to the aftermarket to make the car 'Premium', floor mats, boot liners, A wireless phone charger, memory stick for sensory mode, sun roof shade panels for summer, trunk struts, puncture repair kit and window tinting just a start.... \nBut it is a massive leap forward by Mr Musk. He will over time become better at making them, and Europe and Korea will no doubt catch and over take him.  They have been making cars for 90yrs after all, but the Model 3 is a joy to own and drive, a pleasure to travel in, and always gets interest and questions. \nTesla after sales support has been good.\nI give it a 9/10.... so far.\n","featuredImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/caradvice/image/private/s--8GvJY0hr--/v1595198704/mnlzz8lejqzoblbauudu.jpg","id":"cG9zdDoyODIxMjc5","databaseId":2821279,"title":"mnlzz8lejqzoblbauudu","caption":"","cloudinary":{"cloudName":"caradvice","publicId":"mnlzz8lejqzoblbauudu","deliveryType":"private","__typename":"Cloudinary"},"__typename":"CustomMediaItem"},"author":{"name":"Owner
