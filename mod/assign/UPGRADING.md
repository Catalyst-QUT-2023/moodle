# mod_assign Upgrade notes

## 4.5dev

### Removed

- The default option "Never" for `attemptreopenmethod` setting, which disallowed multiple attempts at the assignment, has been removed. This option was unnecessary because limiting attempts to 1 through the `maxattempts` setting achieves the same behavior.

  For more information see [MDL-80741](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-80741)

### Deprecated

- The constant `ASSIGN_ATTEMPT_REOPEN_METHOD_NONE` has been deprecated, and a new default value for `attemptreopenmethod` has been set to "Automatically until pass".

  For more information see [MDL-80741](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-80741)

### Added

- A new default value for `attemptreopenmethod` has been set to "Automatically until pass".
